## macros vs functions
`println()` is a function
`println!()` is a macro.
`!` denotes macro instead of function.

## cargo
- Rust build system & package manager. Handles stuff like building code abd downloading and building libraries.

- creating project with cargo:
`cargo new hello_cargo` creates a new directory named 'hello_cargo'. Creates a `Cargo.toml` file and an `src` directory containing `main.rs`.

- TOML config format = Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language config format

- source files should be in the `src` directory.

- build with `cargo build`

- run executable in created `target` directory with `./target/debug/hello_cargo`

- `cargo build` also creates a top-level `Cargo.lock` file which "keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project"

- can also just use `cargo run` which combines the above two steps.

- `cargo check` builds your code (compiles) but doesn't create an executable. This is the fastest option if you're just wanting to check that everything compiles.

- `cargo build --release` compiles with optimizations. Creates an executable in `target/release` instead of `target/debug`.

- "you can use the following commands to check out the code using Git, change to that project's directory, and build"
`git clone someurl.com/someproject`
`cd someproject`
`cargo build`
